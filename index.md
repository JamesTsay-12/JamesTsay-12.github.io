# Welcome to My Personal Website!

Hi, I'm James Tsay — a scientist, builder, mentor, and creative generalist. I spent my career in academia and in the biotech industry leading to R&D for next-generation sequencing platforms. I’ve worked at both startups and large companies, including Illumina, where I helped shape technologies that have impacted global genomics and diagnostics.

I’m most fulfilled when finding creative solutions, working with thoughtful people, and translating science into something meaningful, usable, and impactful for human life.

Outside work, I’m passionate about music composition (especially atmospheric/film-inspired guitar and keyboard work), art, writing, and exploring how science, finance, identity, and creativity intersect. I’m currently composing original music, writing reflections on science, society, and personal growth, and exploring what it means to contribute in a more personal, authentic way.

I believe in deep thinking, practical execution, and challenging the status quo when needed. I care about integrity, curiosity, and doing good work with good people — whether that’s in biotech, education, media, or something yet to be invented.
This site is a home for my evolving projects — science writing, music, personal reflections, and experiments in new modes of work and impact.

Thanks for visiting!
